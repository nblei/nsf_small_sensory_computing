Dr. Kumar has served as PI on the following NSF-funded project in the last five
years: CCF- 2006763 SHF (from 2020-2023 \$500K).  CCF-2006763 SHF Printed
Computer Systems (\$500K, October 2020- September 2023). Intel- lectual Merit:
The project has already resulted in first sub-cent microprocessor
\cite{bleier2022flexicores}, first plastic encryption
engines\cite{Bleier_2023}, first work on printed
microprocessors\cite{Bleier_2020}, and first work on printed
classifiers\cite{Mubarik_2020}. Broader Impact: This project has opened up new
possibilities for ultra-low cost and conformal active electronics, enabling
applications such as wearable patches\cite{elfaramawy2018wireless},
garments~\cite{rinaldi2018wearable}, packaging~\cite{gethin2013printed} for
fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), low-end healthcare products such as smart
bandages~\cite{derakhshandeh2018smart}, and disposable sensors for
food~\cite{chen2017disposable}, pharmaceuticals~\cite{bergamini2005disposable},
agriculture and forestry~\cite{syrovy2020fully}, and
environment~\cite{marrazza1999disposable} â€” that have not seen much penetration
of computing.
