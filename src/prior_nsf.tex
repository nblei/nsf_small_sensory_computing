Dr. Kumar has served as PI on the following NSF-funded project in the last five
years: CCF- 2006763 SHF (from 2020-2023 \$500K).  CCF-2006763 SHF Printed
Computer Systems (\$500K, October 2020- September 2023). Intel- lectual Merit:
The project has already resulted in first sub-cent microprocessor
\cite{bleier22}, first plastic encryption engines\cite{bleier23}, first work on printed
microprocessors\cite{bleier20}, and first work on printed classifiers\cite{mubarik20}. Broader
Impact: This project has opened up new possibilities for ultra-low cost and
conformal active electronics, enabling applications such as wearable patches\cite{},
garments~\cite{}, packaging~\cite{} for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG),
low-end healthcare products such as smart bandages~\cite{}, and disposable sensors
for food~\cite{}, pharmaceuticals~\cite{}, agriculture and forestry~\cite{}, and
environment~\cite{} — that have not seen much penetration of computing.
