We report here a prototype self-heated hydrogen gas sensor based on Pt-coated W18O49 nanowire networks. Such a sensor has been shown to have promising performance, e.g., high sensitivity (able to detect down to 50ppm of H2), good selectivity (poor response to ethanol, CH4, CO, and C3H8), and low power consumption of 30–60mW at 6V compatible to a portable device. Coaxial cable model and percolation theory are applied to explain the gas sensing effect of the Pt-coated W18O49 nanowire networks.}

abstract = {Gas nanosensors with good “3S” (sensitivity, selectivity and stability), ultralow power consumption and low cost are increasingly needed for portable electronic devices. Herein, we demonstrate the facile fabrication process of individual, multiple, and networked SnO2 nanowire (NW) sensors, which can be used to detect highly toxic NO2 gas based on the Joule self-heating effect, consuming only few tens of μW of power. Systematic investigation on the gas-sensing properties reveals that the individual NW sensor shows advantages, such as better gas response shorter response–recovery time and lower power consumption over multiple and networked NW sensors. The self-heated individual NW sensor with applying a bias voltage of 25V exhibits a good response to NO2 gas concentrations as low as 1ppm with short response (∼8s) and recovery times (∼25s) and consumes only 35μW of power. In addition, the gas-response of individual NW sensors operated by either self- or external heating was compared to demonstrate the advantages of the development of the sensor concept for practical applications.}

abstract = {Embedding chemical sensors into mobile devices is an emerging demand in modern information converged technology. The unbearable power consumption to raise the temperature of chemoresitive-type chemical sensors makes it impossible for them to be embedded regardless of their peculiar sensing properties such as low cost, miniaturization, high response, and excellent stability and robustness. In this study, self-heated nanowire sensors were prepared by exploiting the synergic effect of the core–shell structure and catalytic nanoparticles. As a prototype approach, Pt nanoparticle-functionalized SnO2–ZnO core–shell nanowires were synthesized, demonstrating extremely striking performance and characteristics. Thicker ZnO shell showed the larger self-heating and higher sensor response. The sensors exhibited excellent selectivity for toluene gas, with negligible responses to other reducing gases. This one possessed a considerable sensing performance at room temperature, even without a significant self-heating. The self-heated sensing of the novel core–shell nanowires developed required only an extremely low power consumption of 31μW, suggesting their potential in applications as sensors embedded into mobile devices.}

abstract = {We devised a new low power consumption nanocomposite sensor based on Pd-functionalized SnO2-ZnO core-shell nanowires (C-S NWs) in self-heating mode. Functionalization of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) was performed by γ-ray radiolysis at room temperature. Characterization results confirmed formation of the C-S NW morphology with the desired composition. The effects of various applied voltages (1−20 V) and different gases upon the sensing response of synthesized NWs was examined. In particular, increasing the applied voltage increased the gas sensitivity, where the response for 50 ppm C6H6 was 1.19 at 3 V, and it increased to 2.62 at 20 V through the generation of heat within the sensor via self-heating. Additionally, the sensors revealed outstanding selectivity towards C6H6. The effects of sensing temperatures (RT-200 °C) without applied voltages were also studied. The high response to C6H6 along with the excellent selectivity was due to the unique design of the sensor and the catalytic activity of Pd towards C6H6. The sensor in self-heating mode consumed only 70.5 nW at 5 V, indicating a good potential to be integrated in portable, low power consumption electronic devices.}

abstract = {In this study, we fabricated pristine and Pd-functionalized CuO nanowires (NWs) for H2S gas sensing. The CuO NWs were synthesized using a vapor–liquid–solid method and the Pd functionalization was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation of a Pd precursor solution in the presence of the CuO NWs. The characterization results confirmed the formation of pristine and Pd-functionalized CuO NWs with favorable compositions and morphologies. The gas-sensing response of the NWs towards H2S was enhanced by the Pd functionalization, at 25–100 °C. Moreover, self-heating tests showed that the Pd-functionalized gas sensors exhibited a selective response to H2S gas when a low voltage (5 V) was applied. The superior performance of the Pd-functionalized gas sensor was attributable to not only the catalytic effects of both CuS and Pd but also the CuO/Pd heterostructures. The results demonstrate that the fabricated H2S sensors are energy-efficient and could be used in various electronic devices.}

Au nanoparticles (NPs) were decorated on WS2 NSs using UV irradiation technique at different irradiation times (1, 15 and 30 s). SiO2 grown on Si was used as substrates and the gas sensors with top electrode configuration were fabricated. Gas sensors were able to work under self-heating mode with an applied voltage of 2 V for selective CO sensing. The results of CO gas sensing demonstrated the promising effects of Au for the enhanced response and selectivity towards CO gas. Also, the low-voltage operation at room temperature resulted in low-power consumption. This study demonstrates realization of selective CO gas sensor using a facile approach along with low power consumption.}

abstract = {The complex dynamic behavior of nonlinear harvesters make it difficult to identify the optimum mechanical and electrical parameters for maximum output power, when compared to linear energy harvesting devices. In addition, the chaotic and multi-frequencies characteristics of responses under realistic human motion excitations provide additional challenges for enhancing the energy harvesting performance, such as the traditional frequency domain method being inappropriate for optimum resistance selection. This paper provides detailed numerical and experimental investigations into the influence of resistance on the efficiency of nonlinear energy harvesting from human motions. Numerical simulations under human motions indicate that optimum resistance of a nonlinear harvester can be attained to maximize the power output. Moreover, simulations of linear and nonlinear harvesters under harmonic excitations verify the effectiveness of frequency dominant method to obtain optimum resistance in the absence of a change in the dynamic behavior of the harvester. However, numerical simulations and experiments are the effective methods when the harvester shows complex dynamic characteristics. Experimental measurements of harvested power under different motion speeds and resistances are in agreement to the numerical analysis for the nonlinear harvester. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resistance optimization method for nonlinear energy harvesting from human motions.}
