Research objectives for \olfc{} are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prototype Ahromaa hardware in \(\leq \SI{65}{\nano\meter}\) technology;
\item Analyze Ahromaa and existing olfactory computing hardware in a heterogeneous, networked
     computational setting, in which computation can be offloaded from the earable
     device onto a number of other devices, including smart watches, smart phones,
     and high perfromance cloud systems;
\item Extend the representative olfactory computing applications (Sec~\ref{sec:tract2})
    into a bona fide olfactory computing benchmark suite by
    porting all benchmark code to C and OpenMP, designing representative inputs
    for each benchmark, and providing baselines on existing systems, including
    Ahromaa; enable evaluations for heterogeneous systems --- both
    heterogeneous SoCs, as well as multi-chip and even multi-device systems.
\end{enumerate}
