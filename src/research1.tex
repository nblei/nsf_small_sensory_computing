Research objectives for earable computing are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prototype SpEaC hardware in \(\leq \SI{65}{\nano\meter}\) technology;
\item Analyze SpEaC and existing earable hardware in a heterogeneous, networked
     computational setting, in which computation can be offloaded from the earable
     device onto a number of other devices, including smart watches, smart phones,
     and high perfromance cloud systems;
\item Extend EarBench into a bona fide earable computing benchmark suite by
    porting all benchmark code to C and OpenMP, designing representative inputs
    for each benchmark, and providing baselines on existing systems, including
    SpEaC; enable EarBench evaluations for heterogeneous systems --- both
    heterogeneous SoCs, as well as multi-chip and even multi-device systems.
\end{enumerate}
