Of course, to build earable computing systems, we must understand and analyze
characteristics of earable applications.  In this work, through a survey of
research literature and recent practice, and conversations with earable computing domain experts,
%and our own experience with building and prototyping application specific
%systems, 
we will first identify a set of computation tasks that may be common across
a variety of earable applications.  We will then identify, through
a survey of papers discussing implementations of these tasks, a set of
algorithms that often underpin these tasks.  We will then understand through
profiling-based measurements the computational characteristics of these
algorithms.  An understanding of these
characteristics can be used to build and optimize earable computing systems for different
system-level constraints.

As preliminary analysis,
we conducted a comprehensive survey of earable applications research and
practice~\cite{waverly, nuraphone, scribd, bible, peckhamsarkar_2019},
including over 50 papers on http://esense.io, and interviewed three earable
computing domain experts. We observed that most research and commercial earable
computing applications fall into one of four categories: (1) Human-Machine
Interface (HMI) applications that allow the earable user to interact with the
device (and vice-versa). In the absence of traditional interfaces (e.g.,
keyboard, mouse, touchscreen), interactions are typically via sound and taps.
(2) Audio applications that decode, manipulate, and playback audio data streams
(e.g., phone calls, podcasts, acoustic augmented reality (AAR)). (3) Analytics
applications, such as ECG monitors, that are computation-heavy but should
ideally execute locally on the earable device. Finally, (4) Spatial Awareness
applications that localize the user, their movements, head gestures, etc. for
applications in AR/VR, gaming, location- specific alerts, etc. These spatial
tracking applications are often characterized by sensor fusion engines, and are
thus assigned to a separate category. To have a representative, but diverse
suite, we then selected from each category 2-4 applications with different
computational requirements, as determined by profiling
(Table~\ref{tab:earbench_metrics}), and diverse sensor-based inputs. Diversity
was considered also in terms of underlying algorithms (e.g., DSP vs ML, RNN vs
CNN vs BERT) and use cases (e.g., authentication vs recognition, classification
vs NLP, tracking vs localization).

We will continue the analysis to finalize the list of representative computational tasks and then build EarSuite --- the first earable computing benchmark suite --- by porting
    all benchmark code to C and OpenMP, designing representative inputs for
    each benchmark, and providing baselines on existing systems. 
    %We will enable
    %EarSuite evaluations for heterogeneous systems --- both heterogeneous
    %SoCs, as well as multi-chip and even multi-device systems.  
    EarSuite
    --- software, data, \& build scripts --- as well as executable binaries
    for major platforms --- will be published under an open source license in
    order to enable commercial and academic research in earable computing.
%    EarBench will consist of a diverse and representative set of current and
 %   future earable computing applications.  
 Data inputs will be drawn from
    real world inputs (e.g., measured microphone, accelerometer, \& ECG data),
    popular queries to current question-answering systems (e.g., Alexa,
    Google Assistant, etc.).

    EarSuite will be published with a CMake based build system.  As CMake
    is an open-source, cross platform build automation tool targeting all
    major operating systems, and since nearly all computer architectures
    have open source or proprietary C compilers, researchers will be able
    to get EarSuite running on a wide variety of systems quickly and easily.
    For major architectures (e.g., ARMv7, ARMv8, x86\_64, i686, etc.),
    we will provide prebuilt EarSuite binaries.

The next goal is to explore computer architectures for earable processing. Naturally, the question arises --
%Are today's hardware platforms not good enough to support earable applications? Second, 
what are the key computational characteristics that any earable computing platform should target?
% We analyze the EarBench suite to identify the key
% computation kernels in earable  applications.
 Figure~\ref{fig:kernels_breakdown} shows the performance breakdown of some representative applications
 across constituent kernels on a single Cortex A72 (profiling was performed on Raspberry Pi 4).  Applications were
 compiled with gcc 9.2 and rustc 1.5 with `O3' optimizations (which include
 SIMD auto-vectorization).

Figure~\ref{fig:kernels_breakdown} shows that earable applications are
built out of a small number of computationally intensive DSP and ML
kernels.  At first glance, this commonality of kernels in applications
%crossing four taxonomic categories, with
across  a wide range of use-cases (e.g., audio playback, text processing,
heart-rate monitoring, speech processing, etc.) may seem surprising.
However, note that these applications are implemented broadly using techniques from digital signal processing and machine learning; 
%DSP and ML computation are well-known to both be dominated by a small number of computation kernels and share  computation kernels between them~\cite{narayan2019novel}. 
%\nathan{
Machine learning and DSP kernels have similar computation.
A neural network consists of an alternating sequence of linear transformations and non-linear activation functions. Computing the action of a linear transformation, $W$, on an input vector, $a$, is given by $b = Wa$.  Given a choice of basis, $W$ and $a$ can be expressed in matrix form, and computing the $i$'th output of $b$ is
\begin{equation}
    b_i = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} a_jW_{ij}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a real or complex vector, $x$, is given by the linear transformation $X = Wx$, and $W_{nk} = e^{-i2\pi/N}$ is an element of the order $N$ subgroup of the unit circle group.
Thus, the `frequency-domain' output
\begin{equation}
   X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] W_{nk}
\end{equation}
is remarkably similar to the core computation of a neural network.
Two factors complicate using a substrate optimized for ML kernels to be used for DSP kernels and vice versa. First, neural networks typically are real-valued, while DFT is complex valued.  Second, symmetries in the DFT's transformation enable a `fast' $O(n\log n)$ Fourier transform by recursively subdividing the $N$-point DFT into smaller and smaller sub-blocks.  Similarly, neural networks often exploit symmetries of their own to greatly reduce required computation and data movement by using convolution layers.
Despite these complications, striking similarities remain.  Both DFT and neural network computations are made up of real-valued multiplications followed by additions/subtractions, and in both the number of multiplications needed is nearly identical to the number of additions/subtractions needed. This suggests that an efficient processor architecture for earable applications is a neural network accelerator that is augmented with support for complex processing and that can be reconfigured to support different dataflows for the different ML and DSP kernels. 

Furthermore, since the dataflows of dot-product and complex multiplication, the key subcomputations of neural networks and FFT, respectively, consist of scattering
data streams to multiplication units, followed by reduction (dot-product) and gathering into an output stream (complex multiplication), an architecture which enables scatter-multiply-reduce and scatter-multiply-gather is needed
(Figure~\ref{fig:complex-vs-dot}).
High bandwidth tree-structures for both the scatter network, and for the reduction/gather network should enable efficient computation of machine learning and DSP workloads.

Many classes of programmable hardware, such as GPUs and DSPs, already
accelerate a variety of DSP and ML kernels. However, they draw high power
(e.g., \SI{234}{\milli\watt} for HiFi4 DSP, 1.8W for Mali T628 MP6 GPU vs tens
of \si{\milli\watt}s required for earable hardware) due to their excessive
generality. 
For example, GPUs use expensive floating point
arithmetic (vs fixed point arithmetic that may be adequate for earable
computing kernels), general-purpose microarchitecture (earable applications may largely need only a tree of adders and multipliers customized to the earable ML/DSP kernels), and
dedicated graphics pipelines (that unnecessarily contribute static power in
context of earable computing). 

ML accelerators are not a good fit either
since it is unclear how to map earable DSP kernels such as LU, Bilinear, Cholesky, and FFT on such hardware (due to lack of
support for non-matrix computation, vectorized complex operations, or non-multiply or add
operations, for example).

\end{figure}

We will use EarSuite to drive a design space exploration of computer
architectures for earable processing. An example computer architecture (that we
have preliminarily explored~\cite{bleier2022rethinking}) is  a
stream-programmed~\cite{nowatzki2017stream} coarse-grained reconfigurable
spatial architecture (Figure~\ref{fig:earable_arch}) whose computation
substrate consists of a set of  adders and multipliers (since earable
applications are dominated by inner-product-based computation).
A fat distribution
tree~\cite{leiserson1985fat}  feeds the multiplier units.  The products
of the multiplier units are forwarded to the adders organized in an `augmented
reduction tree', which allows a single tree to perform multiple inner
products concurrently, or to be time-multiplexed to perform a large inner-product across multiple cycles.
The final few adder units are equipped
with accumulators to enable computation of multiple inner-products in parallel. The accumulators may be configured to output either
the accumulated value, $x$, or $\max{\{0, x\}}$, such that the architecture supports
either linear or reLU activation functions.  Max-pooling
layers is supported through the reduction tree by allowing the adder units to also perform
comparison operations.
 The architecture  uses  32-bit fixed-point arithmetic since high quality audio
often has a 24-bit depth, while 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic would %necessarily
lower audio quality. 
Furthermore, since FFT is a key computational kernel in earable application, the
functional units support vectorized complex operations. To enable 
multiplication of complex numbers, two adjacent multipliers form a pair to create a  {\em
logical vector multiplier}.
%which perform complex multiplication and
%addition on streams of complex numbers (in array-of-structs form). In order to
%support this the vectorized PEs 
Each logical vector multiplier can be configured to either perform a 2x32 bit
multiplication or a 2x32 bit multiplication in which one of the 64-bit inputs'
top and bottom 32-bits are swapped. Also, since $i^2 = -1$, the real component
of the complex product is produced by computing the difference of two of the
partial products while the imaginary component is produced by computing the sum
of the other two partial products. To support this,  adjacent adders in level 3
of the tree form  \textit{logical vector adders}. The `left' adder in a logical
vector adder can be configured to perform subtraction as well as addition. The
control core executes code that does not fit well on the reconfigurable
substrate, including non-multiply or add operations in the DSP kernel code
(e.g., square-root and divide operations in LU and Cholesky).

There are several other computer architectures possible as well. One
possibility is to support multiple fixed function accelerators on the earable
SoC each targeting a different set of kernels. For example, an SoC with a CPU,
an ML accelerator, and an FFT accelerator looks attractive for our
applications. However, there are several disadvantages of such an approach.
One, the field of earable computing is relatively new and algorithms are still
evolving. Any system with fixed functions ASICs may become obsolete quickly.
Second,  a collection of special purpose accelerators will fail to provide the
requisite performance for kernels that do not map well to an existing
accelerator. For example, LU, Bilinear, and Cholesky cannot be mapped directly
on an ML accelerator or an FFT accelerator and will need to be run on the CPU
at high performance cost. Similarly, a given kernel may not fit its fixed
function accelerator well depending on the input. For example, FFT size in
tinySR, depends on input audio length and, for our microphone input, varies
from 32-point to 1024-point, HRTF calls a 4096-point FFT, Ambisonic uses a 512
or 1024-point FFT, etc. Many FFT accelerators are optimized for a specific
size~\cite{fft01} and will not run other FFTs of other sizes
efficiently~\cite{fft02}. Nevertheless, a heterogeneous system has benefits in
terms of reusability and cost. We will compare the spatial approaches against
heterogeneous approaches.

We will also prototype and test an earable computer in TSMC \(\leq
\SI{65}{\nano\meter}\) technology. The candidate design, the spatial
architecture described above, shows significant performance and energy
improvement over existing hardware systems used in today's earable computers.
Prototyping sub-objectives include physical design of the architecture to
minimize energy, including design and placement of multiple power and clock
domains, integration of the architecture with commercially licensable SRAMs to
minimize cost, and design for test, chip tape-out, and packaging for workforce
development.  Multiple power domains are used as the architecture is a
heterogeneous system (control core and reconfigurable substrate), and thus
power gating can be used to reduce static power consumption. Similarly, clock
and voltage scaling can be used minimize energy or power consumption when one
or more of the architecture's components has performance slack available.
Although we have a preliminary architecture, a careful exploration would be
needed to determine the optimal choice of operating points.   Similarly,
testing sub-objectives include earable system design and PCB design, porting
EarSuite applications to the chip, and collecting measured EarSuite results.
System design will incorporate multiple earable sensors (e.g., microphone
arrays, inertial motion units), actuators (e.g., speakers, antennae), and a
hardware debug system. Porting EarSuite applications to the chip requires
annotating the EarSuite C code with pragmas which enable the architecture's
compiler to automatically generate configurations and data streams for its
spatial accelerator. PI Kumar is experienced in digital design, chip design,
tape-out and testing, and runs an undergraduate course in which students design
and tape-out processors which are manufactured by TSMC and then tested at UIUC
campus. His research group also participates in Intel's Chip Design Challenge,
in manufacturing RISC-V processors in Intel's \SI{16}{\nano\meter} technology.
The research group has also recently taped out several flexible
chips~\cite{bleier2022flexicores, Bleier_2023}.

    are transmitted over BLE for remote compute offloading, normalized with
    respect to the energy consumed when kernels and applications are
    computed locally.}
  \label{fig:ble}
\end{figure}

A natural question comes up: whether to offload compute to 
mobile device (using BLE, for example) - this will involve sending inputs and outputs over the communication protocol - or compute locally on an earable processor? 
 Communication can be expensive. \cite{ble} claims that it takes $8usec$ to communicate one byte of data over BLE whereas the TX power of BLE is 84mW and RX power is 66mW. 
 %We used power and communication latency numbers from \cite{ble} along with the input and output sizes of our kernels and applications and computed the
%energy consumed by the BLE transceiver.
Figure~\ref{fig:ble}-a shows the 
communication energy of BLE transceiver normalized with respect to the energy consumed by the above proposed spatial architecture when we run the kernels locally on the architecture. Our results show that 
computing kernels locally is on average $\approx4OOM$ more energy efficient compared to communicating inputs/outputs over BLE. This is not surprising since BLE
%although BLE is low power protocol, it 
consumes significant amount of energy ($\approx\SI{0.7}{\micro\joule\per\byte}$~\cite{ble}) when sending large matrices, which are common inputs to our kernels, due to its long communication latency.
Similarly, figure~\ref{fig:ble}-b shows the 
communication energy of BLE transceiver normalized with respect to the energy consumed by the spatial architecture when we run the entire application locally. The results show that 
for compute intensive applications, e.g. Albert, it is more energy efficient to offload compute to remote device,
whereas for all other applications 
computing applications locally is more energy efficient than offloading the compute to remote device over BLE.
On average computing locally  is $\approx12.7\times$ more energy efficient across applications we considered compared to communicating inputs/outputs over BLE. 
%Another possibility is to offload computation to a remote, non-earable device. However, this leads to concerns about energy (since energy of transmitting
%    data wirelessly via BLE is orders of magnitude greater than transmitting
%    data to/from local memory, 
Other than energy benefits, local computation may often be preferred also for improved 
%as well as 
latency, privacy, and usability (since a remote device may not always be available or accessible).

At the same time, applications such as Albert which have high computation and
memory requirements may need to be offloaded to a remote device both for energy
and capability reasons. We will analyze both proposed hardware and existing
earable hardware in a heterogeneous, networked computational settings, in which
computation can be offloaded from the earable device onto a number of other
devices, including smart watches,  smart phones, and high performance cloud
systems. We will use HPVM~\cite{ejjeh2022hpvm} for distributed implementation
of the EarSuite benchmarks. The distributed implementations will be open
sourced and released publicly.
