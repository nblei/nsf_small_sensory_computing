The research, education, and outreach milestones for each year are outlined in
the following table.
\begin{tabular}{||c|p{0.45\linewidth}|p{0.39\linewidth}||}
\hline
\hline
\textbf{Year} & \textbf{Research} & \textbf{Education and Outreach}\\
\hline
\textit{1} &
Develop and publish EarBench and NoseBench benchmark suites to allow further
research in sensory computing;
Evaluate existing sensory computing hardware platforms on EarBench and NoseBench;
Perform architectural design space exploration for \olfc{}, and identify
promising design points;
Finalize SpEaC's physical design, tape-out, fabricate, and package SpEaC chips.
&
Develop initial modules for graduate courses; visits to local schools and
perform community outreach (i.e. Saturday Engineering for Everyone, Engineering
Open House); undergraduate teams work on lab measurement setups \\
\hline
\textit{2} &
Evaluate EarBench on SpEaC prototypes;
Evaluate EarBench on heterogeneous systems (i.e., SpEaC + phone, SpEaC + cloud
server, etc.);
Finalize architecture of \olfc{} prototype, perform physical design and tape-out,
fabricate and package \olfc{} prototype.
&
Develop course modules for graduate and undergraduate courses;
visit school for hands-on demonstrations of SpEaC hardware,
undergraduate teams experiment with refinements to odor sensing and synthesis
equipment.
\hline
\textit{3}  &
Evaluate NoseBench on \olfc{} prototypes;
Evaluate EarBench on heterogeneous systems (i.e., prototype + phone, prototype
+ cloud server, etc.);
 &
Refine course modules; develop K-12 and public demonstrators of sensory
computing; fully integrate undergraduates in research\\

PI Kumar plans to conduct the proposed research, education, and outreach
activities in a highly integrated manner, as the project requires technical and
research expertise from several Computer Science (CS) and Electrical
Engineering (EE) disciplines. To keep the project integrated, we will regularly
communicate among the team members, and hold semi-weekly project-wide meetings.
