Our proposed research is along two thrusts: earable computing (Section~\ref{sec:tract1})
and \olfc{} (Section~\ref{sec:tract2}).
We have already made progress along both thrusts, including initial analysis
of sensory applications and computational workloads, as well as architectural
exploration and identification of architectures which significantly outperform
existing architectures (Sections~\ref{ssec:prelim1} and \ref{ssec:prelim2}).
As sensory computing is often performed by systems with a wearable form factor,
or as part of a sensor network~\cite{}, we also will explore the benefits
of computational offloading onto other devices such as smart watches, phones,
or cloud platforms.
