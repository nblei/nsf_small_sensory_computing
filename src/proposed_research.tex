Our proposed research is along two thrusts: earable computing
(Section~\ref{sec:tract1}) and \olfc{} (Section~\ref{sec:tract2}).  We have
already made progress along both thrusts, including initial analysis of sensory
applications and computational workloads, as well as architectural exploration
and identification of architectures which significantly outperform existing
architectures (Sections~\ref{ssec:prelim1} and \ref{ssec:prelim2}).  As sensory
computing is often performed by systems with a wearable form factor, or as part
of a sensor network~\cite{}, we also will explore the benefits of computational
offloading onto other devices such as smart watches, phones, or cloud
platforms.
