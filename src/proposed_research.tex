Our proposed research is along two thrusts: earable computing (Section~\ref{sec:tract1})
and \olfc{} (Section~\ref{sec:tract2}).
We have already made progress along both thrusts, including initial analysis
of sensory applications and computational workloads, as well as architectural
exploration and identification of architectures which significantly outperform
existing architectures (Sections~\ref{ssec:prelim1} and \ref{ssec:prelim2}).
